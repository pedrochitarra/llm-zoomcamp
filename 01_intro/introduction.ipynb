Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings, for example, \"\\\\n\" to add a new line or \"\\\\t\" to add spaces, etc. To avoid the issue we just need to add \"r\" before the file path and Python will treat it as a literal string (not an escape sequence).\\nHere’s how we should be loading the file instead:\\ndf = pd.read_csv(r\\'C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\Downloads\\\\data.csv\\')\\n(Muhammad Awon)',\n",
